# Personalized dot files for a Linux environment.

1. Remeber that a .dot file is which it's name starts with a . (dot). These file are generally used for configuration purposes. Example: *.bashrc*

2. This repository contains my personalized configurations for vim, git, the kitty terminal emulator and bash. Feel free to use if you want to.

3. Clone this repository anywhere in your machine but remember to copy the dot files in your home directory. Kitty's config file goes into ~/.config/kitty.

4. For vim plugins, inside the *.vim* directory at your home directory, create a new directory called *plugged* and clone (git clone + url) inside the following repositories:
[ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)
[lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim)
[nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
[nerdtree-git-plugin](https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin)
[rainbow](https://github.com/frazrepo/vim-rainbow)
[vim-buftabline](https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline)
[vim-deficons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons)
[nord theme](https://github.com/nordtheme/vim)

5. For color themes, you need to create a *colors* directory inside the *vim* directory. Look at the web for the color theme you like and read documentation.
